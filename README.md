### Introduction

One is often faced with the requirement to just fire a couple of simple URLs, to verify the performance or functionality of a single feature, to create load in order to stress environments and monitor certain things, or simply to create load in addition to another load test.

XLT-NoCoding is a library for XLT and delivers an easy way to define and fire HTTP requests and offers various tools to validate the responses.
Additionally it is possible to filter, select and store data from the response in view of inserting it into the next request or its validation. This is a fast and likewise easy way to define test cases, since **no programming** is needed!
